                  Taking a holistic approach, we contextualize prevailing best
                  practice, and seek to offer solutions which are
                  location-specific and obviate environmental damage.

                  The construction process is carbon intensive, and ensuring
                  green buildings are not created at the expense of the
                  environment elsewhere, requires intelligent identification of
                  country-specific materials and suppliers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This process- particularly as it relates to renewable energy
                  integration- should be mindful of sourcing, repairing and
                  maintaining beyond building handover.
                </li>
                <li>
                  SDO also emphasises flexibility to ensure there is scope for
                  alteration to continue to respond to new technological and
                  digital innovations.

                  We benefit from an increasingly wide selection of potential

                  The distribution of these technologies, though, is uneven,

                  Development can have an immediate effect on local employment,
                  engendering positive sentiment toward clients. With exacting
                  standards, scope for skills uplift, training and fair working
                  conditions, it can have profoundly positive implications in
                  casting the relationship between foreign and local entities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If managed poorly, however, it can have serious reputational
                  risk. The construction industry has issues of mistreatment of
                  migrant workers, poor health and safety rules and
                  discrimination.{' '}
                </li>
                <li>
                  We take our lead from international non-governmental
                  organizations (NGOs) and the International Labour Organization
                  (ILO) to ensure clients are confident their buildings and
                  facilities have been constructed in an ethical manner.{' '}
                </li>
                <li>
                  In particular, we are responsive to protocols on forced
                  labour, and the evolving legal framework which governs
                  identification and remedy.{' '}

                  Our clients have a responsibility to contribute to, and
